# Los Angeles Crime Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis of crime trends in Los Angeles, focusing on identifying peak crime hours, key locations for night crimes, and the distribution of victim ages. By analyzing this data, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of crime patterns, which could help in developing targeted strategies for crime prevention and safety improvements.
